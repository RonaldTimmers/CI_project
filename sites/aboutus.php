            <p>We started CompareImports.com back in 2013. With a lot of great ideas and a vision about how shopping in China could be easier and better. One major downside of shopping in China is the uncertainty about your ordered product. Our vision for the future is to help you with finding the best price and good qualitative products. If that’s possible there is nothing that will keep us from buying in China.</p>

            <p>The real China gadget expert. He knows everything about coupons and trying the ‘unexpected’ devices. It doesn’t matter if it is a media player, smartphone or RC car. The great ideas his twin brother (Gerlof) is initiating are built by Peter! He is a salesman in his other profession, but you will not find a friendlier one.</p>

            <p>The man of the new ideas, some weird and far away from reality but others are fantastic and smart. This does not stop; there are new ideas every week! He likes to haggle the internet for opportunities. In his spare time, he does a residency training for an ophthalmologist.</p>

            <h2 class="media-heading">Bas</h2>
            <p>Bas is the backbone of the company. He handles the most important task. Bas is responsible for the administration and builds CompareImports ready for huge growth in the future. He is a real sport-fanatic, and you cannot get a more all-around soccer player, from goalie to striker. Bas can't wait till his son becomes 6 (has to wait four years). So, all Christmas and birthday presents are remote controlled toys.</p>
